# Tracing Cart Based on STM32F4

https://github.com/Albert-Ludwig/Tracing_cart_STM32.git

## | Finished in McMaster University, Embedded System I.

•	System Architecture: Designed and assembled an autonomous transit vehicle prototype based on the STM32F4 (ARM Cortex-M4) microcontroller; integrated DC gear motors and a dual 5V power supply architecture to drive the mechanical chassis.

•	Embedded Control Algorithms: Developed real-time firmware in C++ to implement motion control logic; engineered steering algorithms capable of maneuvering complex track geometries, including sharp turns (minimum 80°) with high stability.

•	Sensor Fusion & Actuation: Utilized optical reflectance sensors to detect non-reflective track guides (black tape); programmed PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to dynamically adjust motor speed and direction based on sensor feedback data.
